## Playground

The [Whisk GraphQL playground](https://api.whisk.so/graphql) is the best way to explore the APIs comprehensive schema docs, and test queries:

::::steps
### Get your test API key

[Book a quick call](https://calendly.com/papercliplabs-spencer/meeting) to discuss your use case, and get a trial API key to see if Whisk is the right fit for your application.

{/* ### Generate API key if you haven't already

The API key will be sent to your email address. This is the same key you use for the SDK.

<GenerateKey /> */}

### Add authorization header

In the `Headers` section of the playground, add the following:

```json [Headers]
{
  "Authorization": "Bearer <YOUR_API_KEY>"
}
```

### Query the API

Try running a query like this:

```graphql [Example Query]
{
  morphoVaults(where: {chainId_in: [137], whitelisted: true}, limit: 10) {
    items {
      name
      totalSupplied {
        formatted
        usd
      }
  }
}
```

Docs on this coming soon.
