# Identity Kit

Identity Kit simplifies the integration of blockchain naming systems like [ENS](https://ens.domains/), [NNS](https://nns.xyz/), [Farcaster](https://www.farcaster.xyz/), [Uni Names](https://blog.uniswap.org/introducing-uni-eth-your-unique-web3-username), and [Basenames](https://www.base.org/names) into your application.

## Configuration

Before using components or hooks from this kit, configure it in the `WhiskSdkProvider` setup in [getting started steps](/getting-started#wrap-app-in-context-providers):

```typescript
interface IdentityConfiguration {
    // Specify resolvers and their order for sequential resolution.
    resolvers: ("ens" | "farcaster" | "nns" | "uni" | "base")[]; 

    // Optional: Override specific addresses with custom names or avatars.
    overrides?: Record<Address, { name: string; avatar: string } | undefined>;
};
```

## Name 

Purpose: Resolves the name associated with an address.

### React Component
```ts
import { Name } from "@paperclip-labs/whisk-sdk/identity";

<Name address={address} />
```

### Direct Data Access
If you need direct data access you can use the React Hook or the SDK Core:
```ts twoslash
import { useName } from "@paperclip-labs/whisk-sdk/identity";
import { getName } from "@paperclip-labs/whisk-sdk/identity/core";

// Returns a `UseQueryResult` object powered by `react-query`.
const {data: name } = useName({ address });

// Can be used in server components, or outside of React. 
// Need to specify resolvers explicitly since this can be used outside of the WhiskSdkProvider.
const name = await getName("", { address, resolvers })
```

## Avatar

Purpose: Resolves the avatar associated with an address.

### React Component
```ts
import { Avatar } from "@paperclip-labs/whisk-sdk/identity";

<Avatar address={address} size={size} />
```

### Direct Data Access
If you need direct data access you can use the React Hook or the SDK Core:
```ts
import { useAvatar } from "@paperclip-labs/whisk-sdk/identity";
import { getAvatar } from "@paperclip-labs/whisk-sdk/identity/core";

// Returns a `UseQueryResult` object powered by `react-query`.
const { data: avatar } = useAvatar({ address });

// Can be used in server components, or outside of React. 
// Need to specify resolvers explicitly since this can be used outside of the WhiskSdkProvider
const avatar = await getAvatar("", { address, resolvers })
```
